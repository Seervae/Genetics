  <h1>Ginger</h1>
  <h2>Orange cats and torties</h2>

  <br>
  <p>The inheritance of ginger(also called orange or red) is pretty different compared to most genes. They are X-linked, meaning they are located on the X chromosome of the cat.

Female cats have 2 X chromosomes and male cats have an X and a Y chromosome(just like us humans!).
</p>
<br>
<p>
Female cats with both X chromosomes or male cats with an X chromosome that has the ginger gene will be ginger based.
</p><br><p>
Female cats with both X chromosomes or male cats with an X chromosome that does NOT have the ginger gene will be black based.
</p><br><p>
Female cats with an X chromosome that has the ginger gene and an X chromosome that does not have the ginger gene will be a tortoiseshell!

<p>So what does ginger/black based even mean?</p>
<br>
<p>All cats fall into a category of 3 in terms of base colors. Ginger based, black based, and tortoiseshell(which you can also say they’re BOTH ginger and black based). Ginger based cats are most often orange to pale cream, and they always have tabby marks(stripes). Black based cats are harder to tell because they come in a more variety of colors, from solid black to dilute gray tabby, but the key point is that they are never orange!</p>
<br>
<h3>How does inheritance work?</h3>
  <p>For female kittens, she will get 1 X chromosome from mom(mom has 2 X chromosomes so it’s a 50/50 on which one she will get) and 1 X chromosome from dad. Because of this, female kittens will ALWAYS inherit the dad’s ginger/no ginger gene. A black based mom and a ginger based dad or a ginger based mom and a black based dad will ENSURE that the female kitten will be a tortoiseshell!
</p>
<p>For male kittens, he will get 1 X chromosome from mom(again, 50/50 chance) and 1 Y chromosome from dad(so he will be a boy). Because of this, if the dad is ginger or not does not have an effect on his son! Only the mom will give the ginger/no ginger gene to the male kitten. If the mom is ginger based, all of her sons will be ginger based. If the mom is black based, all of her sons will be black based. If the mom is a tortoiseshell, then it’s a coin flip! Half of the boys will be black based and the other half will be ginger based in prediction.
